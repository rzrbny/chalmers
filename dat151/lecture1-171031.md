# Programming languages

Primary purpose:

>    Describe algorithms to be executed by a **machine**
>
>   &rarr; formal language with precise **semantics**

## Some history

* before - circuits
* 1940s - binary machine code (CPU)
* 1950s -  Symbolic assembly **addresses, instructions**
* 1960s - Strucuted programming (imperative) (C, PASCAL, ...) **jumps, stack handling, data layout**
* 1970s - object-orentation **encapsulation, monolithic state**  
  * Smalltalk
  * SIMULA
  * C++
  * Java
  * etc.
* 1980s - declarative programming, functional (ML, Haskell, Clojure), logical, constraint programming **state, execution order**

What increases over time is **abstraction, security, compositionality, correctness**.

But decrease in **freedom, efficiency** but we strive to minimize theese losses. Though often the abstraction and ease of use is more important than the last bit of optimization

## Properties of Languages

* **Productivity:** abstraction, composability, static type checking, succ... of expressions (less bureucracy)
* **Code comprehension:** syntax, comments, literate programming, documentation
* **Correctness:** types, pre- and post-conditions, specifications
  * model checking, static analysis, automated provers
* **Parallelism/concurrency**
* **Hardware independence**
* **Complexity**
* **Modles, packages**

This course only covers up to **structured programming**

# Compilation phases
Different compilation phases and their transitions

## Character sequence

    5 + 6*7     ASCII 53,32,43,32,54        
                            lexer generation
                regular expressions -> lexer

&darr; - lexical analysis

## Token sequence

    Num(5), Op(+), Num(6), Op(* ), Num(7)

&darr; - grammatic analysis, parsing

## Abstract syntax tree

     6   7                    parse generation
      \ /   int             grammars -> parsers
    5   *
     \ / int
      +

&darr; - type checking

## Annotated syntax

    FRONTEND

&darr; - code generation

## Backend - phases below

### JVM Byte code (symobolic, assembly)

    bipush 5
    bipush 6
    bipush 7
    imul
    iadd

&darr; - assembler JASMIN

### JVM Byte code (bits)
.class-files

    16, 5, 16, 6, 16, 7, 104, 96

and then we get output/action.

## "Summary"

The compiler can be seen as a number of small compilers with a source language and a target language. We also need a interpreter to run the code

We take a short cut and interpret the syntax tree
